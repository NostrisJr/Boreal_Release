## ‚ú® Key Features
### üéº Automatic Articulation Set Detection
Boreal instantly detects the active track‚Äôs Articulation Set and mirrors it to a local web page. Switch articulations in real-time via MIDI messages (Note On and Controller types supported) ‚Äî no more menu diving or mouse clicks.

### üì± Universal Web Control
Access Boreal from any device with a browser ‚Äî phone, tablet, or second monitor ‚Äî and control articulations remotely with zero setup.

### üéõ Remote DAW Control (Mackie Protocol)
Boreal doubles as a lightweight DAW controller using the Mackie protocol, including support for transportation and quantisation commands (manually registered). Perfect for streamlined workflows and hands-on control, wherever you are.

### üõ† Articulation Set Editor
Create and edit Articulation Sets with ease, bypassing Logic Pro‚Äôs clunky interface. Boreal‚Äôs editor is fully compatible with Logic, giving you full control with none of the friction.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations to Note
The Track Inspector panel in Logic must remain open for Boreal to function properly. If closed, Boreal briefly toggles it, causing a quick popup effect when switching tracks.

- Unique naming is required for each Articulation Set.

- If you modify an Articulation Set in Logic without resaving it, Boreal won‚Äôt detect the changes.

- After editing a set, Logic requires you to manually reselect it on each track, due to internal caching behavior.

Boreal is built for composers and producers who want speed without compromise. Simple, powerful, and designed to keep you in your creative flow.
